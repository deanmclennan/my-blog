# Aircraft Data Buses

Aircraft data bus systems allow a wide variety of avionics to communicate with one another and echange the required data.

With the ever growing number of avionics systems, the number of wires required to connect them all would be unmanageable. Data buses allow a single wire to carry multiple signals, reducing the number of wires required and reducing the weight of the aircraft.

## Bus Terminology

Bus systems can be either bidirectional (one way) or unidirectional (two way).
